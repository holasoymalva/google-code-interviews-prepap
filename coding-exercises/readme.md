# Coding Exercises

Welcome to the Google Technical Interview Code Challenges section! This section is dedicated to providing a collection of coding exercises and challenges commonly encountered in technical interviews at Google. It serves as a valuable resource for candidates who want to practice and improve their problem-solving skills in preparation for Google interviews or similar technical interviews.

## About
This repository is curated and maintained by a group of developers who have experience with Google technical interviews or have knowledge of the coding challenges typically encountered during the process. Our goal is to assist aspiring software engineers and developers in their interview preparation by providing a comprehensive set of coding exercises.

Please note that the challenges included in this repository are based on common problem patterns and topics observed in Google technical interviews. While they can give you a good understanding of the types of problems you may encounter, they may not exactly reflect the questions asked during interviews. It is important to study a broad range of topics and practice extensively to enhance your chances of success.

## Contents
The repository is organized into different sections based on different topics and areas of focus. Each section contains a set of coding challenges accompanied by problem descriptions and sample inputs/outputs. The challenges cover various areas such as algorithms, data structures, dynamic programming, graph theory, system design, and more.

Here is an overview of the contents of this repository:

* **Algorithms**: This section contains coding challenges that test your knowledge of common algorithms like sorting, searching, graph traversal, dynamic programming, etc.

* **Data Structures**: Here, you will find challenges that assess your understanding and implementation skills for various data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, heaps, and more.

* **Dynamic Programming**: This section focuses on challenges related to dynamic programming, which involves solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler overlapping subproblems.

* **Graph Theory**: Here, you can find challenges related to graph theory, including graph traversal, shortest paths, connectivity, and other graph algorithms.

* **System Design**: This section includes challenges that assess your ability to design scalable and efficient systems. They cover topics such as distributed systems, load balancing, caching, and database design.

* **Additional Topics**: This section encompasses challenges on miscellaneous topics such as bit manipulation, concurrency, string manipulation, and more.
